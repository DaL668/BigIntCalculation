User defined big integers: vector of chars, e.g. {'1',3','6','9','9'}, {'-','8','8','8'}. <br />
Operator overloading: binary operators: +, -, * unary operators: pre/post-increment/decrement, <br />
comparison operators: ==, >=, >, <=, <, I/O: >>, << <br />
Build each big integer digit by digit by creating vectors of chars.
